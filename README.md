# Dummy Locale

Dummy Locale builds a complete copy of the specified source locale at runtime.

## But Why?

> Product Manager: "We need to ensure our application is ready for

> Developer: "Alright, I have extracted all strings to translations."

Even if the product manager takes your assertion on faith, you've likely missed
labels generated by form builders, full error messages displayed when
re-rendering forms, and other strings that Rails defaults to English via
`humanize`. Even [raising on missing translations] will fail to catch these.

Dummy Locale builds a complete copy of your source locale, with each value
"translated" by bracketing it, as below:

The application remains usable but allows developers and product managers to
easily see which strings may have been missed.

## Installation

Add `gem "dummy_locale"` to your Gemfile and bundle. It is recommended this be
added to development and staging environments.

## Usage

Create `config/initializers/dummy_locale.rb` like so:

```ruby
if defined?(DummyLocale)
  DummyLocale.generate(source_locale: :en, destination_locale: :zz)
end
```

Those are the default values for `source_locale` and `destination_locale`. They
can be omitted if desired.

Run `rails server`, visit your application, and switch your locale to the
`destination_locale`.
